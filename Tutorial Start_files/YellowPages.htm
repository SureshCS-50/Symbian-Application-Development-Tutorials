        <P> Read the following chapters of the book, Developing Software for Symbian 
          OS by Steve Babin. 
          <!--note which book?> <\!-->
          : 
        <ol>
          <li>Chapter 1: Smartphones and Symbian OS</li>
          <li>Chapter 2: Symbian OS Quick Start</li>
          <li>Chapter 4: Symbian OS Programming Basics</li>
          <li>Chapter 6: Strings, Buffers, and Data Collection (Important)</li>
          <li>Chapter 12: GUI Application Programming</li>
        </ol>
        This would require about 8-10 days. </p>
        <p align="justify">In addition to this, we also referred to Nokia Forums, 
          NewLC and the book, &quot;Quick Recipes on Symbian OS Mastering C++ 
          Smartphone Development&quot; by Michael Aubert. (Section 4.1 : File 
          Handling) 
          <!-- is this a reference or did you read certain chapters><\!-->
        </p>
        <p>After reading the book we started off with a top-down design
	 of the App (Use case analysis, class design, realization etc). </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <H1>Application Use Case Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>User selects City from a list.</li>
          <li>User selects Category from a list. <!-- note this is an include
		use case of the first one></li><\!-->
          <li>System presents the list of Companies and 
            their phone numbers to the user.</li>
        </ol>
        <H1>Application Architecture</h1>
	<p>A Symbian GUI App contains 4 classes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application View. The root GUI control, this class 
            implements the main window and acts as a container for the other application 
            controls.</li>
          <li>Application UI. This class instantiates the application 
            view and handles the commands sent from the application&#8217;s GUI 
            controls.</li>
          <li>Application document. This class handles the non-GUI 
            data aspects of the application &#8211; the application data. It also 
            instantiates the application&#8217;s UI class.</li>
          <li> 
            <div align="left">Application. The main application 
              class starts the application by instantiating and starting the document 
              class. It also sets the application&#8217;s UID</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div align="center">
          <p><img src="YellowPages_files/classes.JPG" width="788" height="492"> </p>
          <p>&nbsp; </p>
        </div>
	    <!-- note: how do these resource link with the classes above?-->
        <p>The application resource defines a significant part of how the application 
          will appear and function. The resource file is a text file whose name 
          ends in .rss, and is compiled into a binary form by the SDK&#8217;s 
          resource compiler. This compiled version of the resource file is loaded 
          onto the phone along with the application executable and is accessed 
          during application execution. </p>
        <p>For making the GUI components, we must first define the GUI components 
          in the resource file. For our Yellow Pages, we first define a MenuBar. 
          We defined a menubar with just one item, &quot;Select City&quot;. It 
          should then display a dialog with a form to select the city.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="YellowPages_files/city.JPG" width="244" height="264"></p>
        <p align="left">Selecting a City and saving then creates another form 
          which provides options for selecting the category. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="YellowPages_files/category.JPG" width="242" height="262"></p>
        <p align="left">After that, the data is read from a file and the names 
          of companies and their phone numbers are dispayed in a MessageQueryDialog.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="YellowPages_files/box.JPG" width="243" height="265"></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p align="left">The UI class handles the commands from these GUI resources, 
          whereas the CYPagesForm &amp; CYPagesForm1 handle the dialog forms defined 
          in the resource as follows. CYPagesForm &amp; CYpagesForm1 have methods 
          like DynInitMenuPane which initializes the resource defined in the resource 
          files using the resource id, and other methods to handle the forms.
