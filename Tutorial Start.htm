        <P>Symbian is a proprietary operating system designed for mobile devices, 
          with associated libraries, user interface, frameworks and reference 
          implementations of common tools, developed by Symbian Ltd. It is a descendant 
          of Psion's EPOC.</P>
        <P>A little history -- On 24 June 1998, Symbian Ltd. was formed as a partnership between Ericsson, 
          Nokia, Motorola, and Psion, to exploit the convergence between PDAs 
          and mobile phones. Symbian was previously owned by Nokia (56.3%), Ericsson 
          (15.6%), Sony Ericsson (13.1%), Panasonic (10.5%), and Samsung (4.5%). 
          Ten years later to the day, on 24 June 2008, Nokia announced that they 
          intended to acquire all shares that they did not already own.
	Subsequently, Nokia opened up the development of Symbian to
	the broad industry by
	creating the <A href="http://www.symbian.org/index.php">
	Symbian Foundation</A>.</P>
	    <P>In this tutorial,we describe how to get started with Symbian Programming 
          by taking you through the installation steps, and then taking through 
          the design of a sample application. This tutorial assumes that you have 
          worked with C++ before and have a brief knowledge about classes, inheritence 
          etc. If you are facing problems with these topics, please dont start 
          this tutorial before making those concepts clear. This tutorial requires 
          no previous knowledge about Symbian and will be taking you forward from 
          the beginning. The first section in this tutorial describes the installation 
          of the development environment for Symbian Programming and the second 
          part starts from a top down class design for a sample application. </P>

	<H1>Getting Started: Hardware and SDK Installation</H1>
        <P>Part 1: The Hardware</P>
        <P>The first thing you need is a PC / Monitor / mouse and Keyboard. <BR>
          Almost any machine on market today can be used for development, however 
          some would save you a bit of time:<BR>
          don't pay too much attention to the CPU (just avoid if you can the entry 
          level Celeron and Sempron)<BR>
          ...but take as much RAM memory as you can. 1GB seems a minimal requirement 
          if you consider doing serious development <BR>
          ...a big fast hardisk (Speed is important to reduce compilation times 
          and emulator start time, space is a requirement to handle all your SDKs. 
          As an example, you will need 1GB for the S60 3rd FP1 SDK, 500MB for 
          Carbide.c++, etc...). <BR>
          also avoid Windows Vista for now... the ARM toolchain is not yet compatible 
          with it.<BR>
          If everything is ok on the hardware / operating side, you are almost 
          ready to start... one last thing to check: make sure you have enough 
          space on your C: drive. This is not an absolute requirement, but if 
          you don't want to bother mounting virtual drive and editing configuration 
          files again and again, you will need to install everything, the IDE, 
          the SDK(s), your project(s) on C:... so a minimum of 2GB free space 
          is required before starting installation (and this is a minimum!).</P>
        <P> Part 2: The software development toolchain</P>
        <P>Now let's go for a bit of downloading (btw, yes, you will probably 
          need an Internet connection...). So download and install:<BR>
          <A href="http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/Windows/5.6/ActivePerl-5.6.1.638-MSWin32-x86.msi">ActivePerl 
          v5.6.1</A>. The latest 5.8 nor 5.10 versions won't probably work...<BR>
          <A href="http://sw.nokia.com/id/7710eba7-4da7-4ddc-a52a-53b506cadb4a/Carbide_cpp_v2_0_en.exe">The 
          Carbide.c++ IDE</A>. : Carbide.C++ is a software development tool for 
          C++ development on Symbian OS. It is used to develop phones that use 
          the OS, as well as applications that run on that phone. It is based 
          on Eclipse IDE Platform enhanced with extra plugins to support Symbian 
          OS development. The Express version (which is free) is enough if you 
          are a student or just intend to learn Symbian OS development. The Developer 
          version (or better) is required if you plan to do some commercial development.<BR>
          To avoid any problem, be sure to install everything on C: in their default 
          location.</P>
        <P>The Software Development Toolchain: The SDKs</P>
	    <!-- note briefly describe S60></!-->
        <P>The S60 SDK : The S60 Platform (formerly Series 60 User Interface) 
          is a software platform for mobile phones that runs on Symbian OS. S60 
          is currently amongst the leading smartphone platforms in the world. 
          It is owned by Nokia. S60 is licensed by Nokia to other manufacturers 
          including Lenovo, LG Electronics, Panasonic and Samsung.</P>
        <P> Download <A href="http://sw.nokia.com/id/577ad48d-290c-4bb5-8bdf-779ea8a5bc6c/S60_5th_Edition_SDK_v1_0_en.zip">the 
          S60 SDK.</A><BR>
          Install the SDK in its default directory and on the same drive as Carbide.c++<BR>
          At the end of the installation, you will be prompted to install the 
          CSL Arm Toolchain if it is not already installed on your machine. Make 
          sure you install it or you won't be able to compile for the phone target.<BR>
          Reboot your machine</P>
        <P>The Software Development Toolchain: Checking the installation</P>
        <P>At the command prompt type 'epoc'. The S60 emulator window should come 
          up.</P>
